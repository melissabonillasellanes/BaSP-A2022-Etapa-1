# Become a Software Professional 2022

## Week 01
It consists of making a screenflow in Figma using the UI kit provided by Radium, based on the statement detailed below:

The company GigaTech Software Solutions SA provides software development services to other companies. Due to the fact that it has many employees and projects, it has asked us to develop a web system, which we will call “Trackgenix”, which facilitates the recording of hours worked by each employee in each project and work team.

The system has a main screen (Landing) with different sections.
This screen must be Responsive Design, that is, it can be seen on a Desktop, Tablet and Mobile, adapting the content for each screen.
Within the system there are different roles with different functionalities. These are:
-SuperAdmin
-Admin
-Employee
-Employee PM

## Week 02
Create an HTML document that has the same content as the landing of the screenflow of the first week, using the desktop version, and adding all the content that is visible both in this version and in the other versions (title, subtitles, date, text, images, links, etc.) respecting the semantic elements of HTML and saving the progress in a public Github repository.

## Week 03
It consists of including the styles corresponding to the HTML structure of week 02 to ensure that when viewing the page, it looks identical to the landing of the screenflow of the first week.

## Week 04
